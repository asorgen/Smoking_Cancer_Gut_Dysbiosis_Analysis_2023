## Transparency and Reproducibility

This repository contains:         

 * Complete sequence processing pipeline  from raw fastq files using QIIME2, see folder: `processing`
 * Configuration files used for BioLockJ pipeline management, see folder: `analysis/BLJ_config_files`
 * Metadata and taxonomic count files for each sub-study, see folder: `analysis/data`
 * All R Scripts to run the entire analysis pipeline, see folder: `analysis/Rscripts`
 * Results of the analysis (figures and tables), see folder: `output`

See `processing/README` for instructions on how to repeat the entire sequence processing pipeline on your own machine.

See `analysis/README` for instructions on how to repeat the entire analysis on your own machine, thus reproducing all figures and tables. A review module was added to the pipeline to facilitate readers and reviewers comparing the reproduced output the the corresponding components in the manuscript.
